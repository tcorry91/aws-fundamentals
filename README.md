# aws-fundamentals
Hands-on AWS fundamentals labs and daily exercises — documenting my path into Cloud/DevOps (Windows + Git Bash).

## Overview
This repo captures week-by-week labs with real outputs (screenshots, commands, notes). Focus so far: IAM hardening (users → **roles**), EC2 provisioning, S3, and basic Bash automation.

## Completed Labs
**Week 1**
- **Day 1** — Account + AWS CLI setup; verified with `aws s3 ls`.
- **Day 2** — EC2 (Linux): launch, SSH, install Nginx; security groups.
- **Day 3** — IAM: users, groups, least-privilege; MFA enforced.
- **Day 4** — S3 static website hosting; bucket policy + index page.
- **Day 5** — Bash script to list S3 buckets → `s3_report.txt` (manual run).

**Week 2**
- **Day 1** — EC2 lifecycle (Ubuntu): install Apache, serve “Hello Cloud”, verify from local; Stop → Start (IP change) → Reboot → Terminate. (`week2/day1-ec2/`)
- **Day 2** — **IAM Role on EC2 → S3 ReadOnly**: created `S3ReadOnlyRole` (trust: EC2) with AWS-managed `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`; launched EC2 with the role (no static keys). Verified:
  - `sts get-caller-identity` → `assumed-role/S3ReadOnlyRole/...`
  - `s3 ls` works (read scope present)
  - `s3 cp ...` **PutObject** denied (least privilege proven)
  (`week2/day2-iam-role-s3-readonly/`)
  - **Day 3** - RDS MySQL Basics
- RDS MySQL (`db.t3.micro`, gp3 20GiB, Public access: No)
- SG→SG: RDS 3306 allows inbound from EC2 SG
- From EC2, connected over SSL, created `testdb.users`, inserted 1 row
- Reconnected in a fresh session to confirm persistence
- **Day 4** — **S3 policies + practice**: created bucket `aws-lab-tim-2025` with public **object READ** via **bucket policy**; augmented EC2 role (`S3ReadOnlyRole`) with inline policy to allow **PutObject/List only for this bucket**; uploaded from EC2 and verified public URL returns content. (`week2/day4-s3-policy-public-read/`)
- **Day 5** — **Mini app (EC2 + RDS)**: Apache+PHP on EC2 connects to RDS MySQL (`testdb.users`), renders rows over HTTP. RDS SG allows 3306 from EC2 SG. (`mini-app/`)


## Key Concepts Learned
- IAM: root vs IAM users, groups, MFA; **roles vs users**, trust policies, **instance profiles**, **temporary creds via STS**; least privilege via bucket-scoped inline policy.
- S3: buckets vs objects; **Bucket policy vs ACL** (prefer bucket policies; ACLs usually disabled by “Bucket owner enforced”); **Block Public Access** gate; virtual-hosted URL format.
- EC2: SSH keys, security groups (ingress 22/80), stop/start/reboot/terminate, ephemeral public IPs; **IMDSv2 required**.
- RDS: private endpoints, SG→SG connectivity (EC2 → RDS on 3306), SSL client connections.
- Bash on Windows (Git Bash): scripting, execution bits, redirection.


**temporary creds via STS**.
- S3: buckets vs objects, public site hosting, bucket policies.
- EC2: SSH keys, security groups (ingress 22/80), stop vs start vs reboot vs terminate, ephemeral public IPs (Elastic IP if you need static), **IMDSv2 required**.
- Bash on Windows (Git Bash): scripting, execution bits, redirecting output.
### Commands
mysql --ssl-mode=REQUIRED -h <endpoint> -P 3306 -u admin -p
CREATE DATABASE testdb; USE testdb;
CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(50), email VARCHAR(100));
INSERT INTO users (name,email) VALUES ('Alice','alice@example.com');
SELECT * FROM users;
