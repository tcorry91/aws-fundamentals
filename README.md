# aws-fundamentals
Hands-on AWS fundamentals labs and daily exercises — documenting my path into Cloud/DevOps (Windows + Git Bash).

## Overview
This repo captures week-by-week labs with real outputs (screenshots, commands, notes). Focus so far: IAM hardening, EC2 provisioning, S3, and basic Bash automation.

## Completed Labs
**Week 1**
- **Day 1** — Account + AWS CLI setup; verified with `aws s3 ls`.
- **Day 2** — EC2 (Linux): launch, SSH, install Nginx; security groups.
- **Day 3** — IAM: users, groups, least-privilege; MFA enforced.
- **Day 4** — S3 static website hosting; bucket policy + index page.
- **Day 5** — Bash script to list S3 buckets → `s3_report.txt` (manual run).

**Week 2**
- **Day 1** — EC2 lifecycle (Ubuntu): install Apache, serve “Hello Cloud”, verify from local; Stop → Start (IP change) → Reboot → Terminate. (`week2/day1-ec2/`)

## Key Concepts Learned
- IAM: root vs IAM users, groups, MFA, least privilege.
- S3: buckets vs objects, public site hosting, bucket policies.
- EC2: SSH keys, security groups (ingress 22/80), service management (`systemctl`), stop vs start vs reboot vs terminate, ephemeral public IPs (Elastic IP if you need static).
- Bash on Windows (Git Bash): scripting, execution bits, redirecting output.
